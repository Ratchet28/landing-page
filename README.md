# landing-page 

The first big project on the Odin Project, will try to keep this updated as we go along
After finishing the last lesson, it feels like some of the HTML & CSS is staring to click.

Did the hmtl today, will have to see if i missed anything in there once I start css.
Feel like i have a pretty good understanding of html at this point.
